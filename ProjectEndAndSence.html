                END-AND SENCE is an interactive drama performed by seven intelligent agents embodying classic characters. After the conclusion of their own enduring stories, they return to the stage, engaging in entirely new dialogues through
                AI-driven generative logic."
                <br><br>
                Based on research of their original scripts, literary works, and character settings, the contextual framework for each role was established, defining their temporal placement, dialogue styles, and generative logic. This enables the AI
                characters to communicate freely while remaining consistent with their predefined identities. The characters include: Hua Mulan, Don Quixote, Sun Wukong, Frankenstein, Carmen, Galileo, and Faust.
                <br><br>
                "And Scene" is both a stage term (signifying the end of a scene) and a homophone of "End Scene," symbolizing how "exiting" characters continue (and) to perform. Audience members trigger the rotation of the stage by pressing buttons,
                while the screen switches between virtual characters who engage in dialogue.
                <br><br>
                The AI language model generates responses based on preceding lines, demonstrating linguistic flexibility and the logic of improvisational theater. At times, the characters gradually converge in their exchanges, forming
                trans-contextual and cross-cultural "resonance," while at other times, conflicts and contradictions arise due to disparities in their "personalities." This approach not only shapes the dynamic evolution of inter-character
                relationships but also ensures that each dialogue becomes a unique, open-ended theatrical form that cannot be predetermined.

                  Before integrating generative AI, my core concept stemmed from direct theatrical practice. The work's framework was directly inspired by the improvisational comedy techniques of "Crossroads" and the "Left Turn" game.

                <p>
                  The live rules of the "Left Turn" game — where four actors stand at the vertices of a square, with two actors facing the audience at any time performing in pairs, and switching dialogue combinations through commands — were
                  translated into the operational logic of a mechanical or digital interactive installation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  The initial concept was to build a system with seven characters. Audience members, through a "button-press" like action, would trigger switches between character pairings. This switching might produce pre-set, limited combinations
                  of dialogue segments. The aim was to mimic the rhythmic and formal sense of "rotation" found in improvisational theatre, rather than to achieve truly infinite content generation. The focus at this stage was on exploring the form of
                  interaction, not on content generation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, after analyzing numerous story archetypes and drawing from personal reflection,
                  I wanted to see characters labelled as "heroes" engage in discussion after their stories concluded.
                  This was the content I wished to see.

                <p><b>Design Rationale:</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Diversity of Cultural Backgrounds:</b> Covering China, Spain, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, avoiding homogenized dialogue within a single cultural context.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Anachronisms and Disparate Fields:</b> Juxtaposing a Renaissance scientist (Galileo), a medieval knight (Don Quixote), and a modern sci-fi creator (Frankenstein). These "impossible encounters" are inherently a source of drama.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Embodiment of "Post-Narrative":</b> All characters exist after their original story's conclusion or in a state of reflection. Hua Mulan has already returned from the army to civilian life. Sun Wukong has already attained the
                  status of the Victorious Fighting Buddha. Don Quixote has already awakened from his fantasies. Faust and Frankenstein are confronting the costs of their pursuits. Carmen is gazing at the endpoint of her fate. Galileo persists in
                  upholding his truth under house arrest.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  This transforms them from heroes "in action" to philosophers "in reflection," making them exceptionally suitable for deep, philosophical dialogue.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  These seven characters are like seven nodes on a "rhizomatic" network. There is no single center among them (such as a traditional "God" or "authority"). Each node can connect with any other, generating new meanings. The
                  installation, through audience button presses, simulates precisely this "decentralized" mode of connection, allowing meaning to constantly generate, shift, and diffuse through the free combination of characters.

                  <b>Key Technology:</b> Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A dedicated "RAG knowledge base" was built for each character, embedding classic script lines and behavioural patterns to ensure consistency in the style and knowledge
                  level of the generated content.

                <p>
                  <b>System Architecture:</b> A Multi-Agent System (MAS). Each virtual character was designed as an intelligent agent, managed and coordinated through the MAS to simulate the "offer-response" mechanism of improvisational comedy.

                <p><b>Artistic Decisions Through Prompt Engineering:</b></p>

                <br>
                <p>
                  My primary artistic decisions are reflected in the systematic
                  constraint and guidance of AI output through meticulous
                  "prompt engineering" and the construction of "character line archives,"
                  ensuring alignment with my dramatic goals.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Decision:</b> To write extremely detailed backgrounds, personalities, dialogue styles, and behavioural constraints (agents) for each character, rather than relying on the AI to generate content freely from scratch.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Example (from my prompt):</b> For instance, I chose settings from the concluding phases of each character's story. For "Mulan," I explicitly set her in a "post-war, reclusive" life stage, specified her language as "concise and
                  powerful, plain yet philosophical," and constrained her to "prioritize using practical experience from the battlefield... to support arguments." I also pre-defined key "trigger words" (e.g., [battlefield], [family]) and their
                  corresponding typical responses.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  These decisions directly counteracted the AI's potential to produce generic, anachronistic, or character-inconsistent output. They weren't corrections applied after a single generation, but rules established before generation,
                  improving the quality and consistency of the output at the source.

                  After the AI generated text, my focus shifted from "generation" to "curation" and "refinement."
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Manual Editing:</b> Faced with the AI's often lengthy and sometimes redundant dialogue streams, my work involved modifying dialogue length and sentence breaks, preserving the lines that best embodied character traits and created
                  dramatic spark, thereby shaping the dialogue's rhythm.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Re-contextualization:</b> My core work involved placing these generated dialogues within the framework of my original concept: the "Post-Narrative Theatre." Through the artist's statement, I emphasized that this is theatre "after
                  the curtain call," where characters converse "after the hero's journey." This act in itself is a re-contextualization of the AI-generated elements, imbuing them with a shared, reflective, philosophical tone—a top-level architecture
                  that the AI itself could not conceive.

                Creative divergence
                </h2>
                <p>Creative divergencewas manifested when the AI's output occasionally exceeded my precise presets, demonstrating a degree of autonomous "association" or "fusion" capability.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Instance:</b> During generation, the AI sometimes made the characters "gradually converge" in their communication, forming a kind of "trans-contextual, cross-cultural 'resonance'"; at other times, due to differing settings, it
                  generated "contradiction and conflict."
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Impact:</b> This unpredictability, particularly the emergence of "resonance," made me realize and ultimately accept the potential of AI as a creative partner. It was no longer merely a tool mechanically executing instructions but
                  could contribute narrative textures I hadn't pre-set (such as philosophical consensus between characters). This influenced and enriched the final artistic presentation of the "dynamic evolution of inter-character relationships."

                <p><b>The Role of AI in the Final Work:</b></p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  In the final work, the core importance of the AI-generated elements lies in:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Achieving Narrative Coherence:</b> The AI's ability to generate subsequent text based on preceding text is the technical foundation for maintaining the natural flow of dialogue and forming a "narrative stream."
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Providing the Unknown and Unexpected:</b> The AI's unpredictability ensures the uniqueness of each interaction, allowing the audience (and even myself) to "maintain curiosity persistently" because no one can foresee the exact
                  content of the next dialogue segment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Serving as Irreplaceable Content:</b> Mature text generation technology means that the "textual dialogue content" itself becomes the performing subject of the work. These real-time, emergent dialogues are the most core,
                  irreplaceable assets of the piece. The AI effectively embodies the coherence of the narrative content while being filled with unknowns and surprises, allowing the audience to watch this video content with sustained curiosity.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  In my work, I did not use AI merely as an auxiliary tool. Instead, I leveraged the characteristics of AI language generation, its randomness and contextual continuity—for creation, such as character simulation and response
                  generation. This results in a theatre without a fixed script or ending; it is an ongoing improvisation. The audience can watch a short dialogue to understand the characters' personalities and the ongoing events, yet there is no
                  complete conclusion or fixed path.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Linguistic Extensibility and Improvisational Logic:</b> The AI's characteristic of "responding to the previous line by generating the next one" embodies "linguistic extensibility and improvisational theatre logic." This is a
                  crucial non-deterministic element introduced by the AI: it simulates the human improvisational actor's mindset of "acceptance and building," allowing the dialogue to flow forward with a seemingly autonomous vitality, which greatly
                  enriches the dramatic authenticity of the creative process.

                  The most significant limitations are:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Absolute Dependence on Preset Systems:</b> The AI cannot autonomously generate the "character archives," "RAG knowledge bases," or the top-level artistic concept of "Post-Narrative Theatre" that I constructed for it. These are
                  one hundred percent human artistic decisions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  <b>Maintaining Deep Consistency:</b> Despite prompt constraints, the AI can still generate content that superficially meets requirements but lacks deep psychological logic or cultural accuracy. This necessitated my continuous
                  iterative optimization of prompts and post-generation manual selection and editing to safeguard the work's artistic depth and academic rigor. My role was that of a "director" and "gatekeeper," ensuring that the AI, this
                  "improvisational actor," did not deviate from the core concept of the drama.
